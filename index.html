            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <div class="steps-grid">
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>Book a consultation with one of our solar professionals. We will discuss budget, your electricity generation requirements, rebates, and go through any questions that you may have.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>Based on the information discussed, we will draw up a suitable solar panel plan for your property.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Once a proposal is signed, we will proceed to contact your energy provider for permission to get started. This process is called 'pre-approval'. For any Solar Victoria rebates, you will receive a form to fill out. Fill it out and you'll be able to receive the government funding.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>We will schedule a suitable date and time for the installation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    <p>Once your solar installation is completed, we will organize an inspector from EnergySafe Victoria to check that everything is safe and working as it should be. He will issue a compliance certificate and then you can start harnessing energy from the sun to power your home.</p>
